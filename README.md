# HTML & CSS Practice Projects

This repository contains various small projects and experiments I built while learning HTML and CSS.

### Folder Structure
- **YouTube Clone** – A simple front-end clone of YouTube.
- **Portfolio Page** – Personal portfolio layout practice.
- **Login Form** – Styled form with responsive design.
- **Thumbnails/** – Common images used across multiple projects.
- **CSS/** – Stylesheets for different mini-projects.

### Note
Some CSS and image folders are shared across projects to maintain consistent design and file paths.
